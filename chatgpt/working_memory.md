# Active topics

## Topic: AI Strategy
**Why this matters (1–2 lines)**  
I want to lead AI initiatives and credibly talk to tech executives about AI strategy. I want to position myself ahead of the curve.

**Current mental model (5–7 bullets max)**  
- (skipped for now)

**Tensions / uncertainties**  
- What “ahead of the curve” means in practice (skills, proof, network, artifacts).
- How to balance strategy depth vs breadth across models, products, and org change.

**Open questions**  
- What’s the 90-day plan that produces credible artifacts (talks, case studies, demos)?
- What executive-level AI strategy questions do I need to be able to answer cold?

**Next likely step**  
- Next: Define 2–3 “signature points of view” on AI strategy and the evidence needed for each.  
- If-success-then: Create one public artifact (memo or framework) and one internal case study.

## Topic: Product Leadership
**Why this matters (1–2 lines)**  
I want to expand product leadership skills and combine them with consulting and delivery. I want my “generalist superpower” to be product.

**Current mental model (5–7 bullets max)**  
- (skipped for now)

**Tensions / uncertainties**  
- How to balance “product craft” vs “consulting delivery” without becoming shallow at both.
- Whether to specialize (a niche) or stay broad (generalist advantage).

**Open questions**  
- What does “my product superpower” look like behaviorally (what do I do better than peers)?
- What feedback loop will compound fastest (writing, advising, building, teaching)?

**Next likely step**  
- Next: Write a one-page definition of my product operating system (principles + weekly cadence).  
- If-success-then: Choose one capability to train for 4 weeks (e.g., discovery, strategy, pricing, narrative).

## Topic: Parenting
**Why this matters (1–2 lines)**  
I want each interaction with my daughters to matter. I need to decouple parenting from work and continue nurturing gentle parenting.

**Current mental model (5–7 bullets max)**  
- (skipped for now)

**Tensions / uncertainties**  
- Work-from-home intensity leaves “open loops” that keep my attention partially at work.
- When I skip a transition, I’m not present (sometimes I don’t even register what they’re saying/doing).
- I need a ritual that works even when I’m depleted and the kids are 3 and 1 (no “sit still” activities).

**Open questions**  
- Which hallway ritual is most reliable: (a) close open loops first, (b) breathing + phone park, (c) “floor drop” connection?
- What are my top 1–2 “breakers” (phone, hunger, stress residue) and what’s the smallest fix?

**Next likely step**  
- Next: Run a 5-workday “Hallway Airlock” experiment:
  - Optional 15s shutdown: write 2 bullets (top open loop + next action tomorrow)
  - Hallway (90s): park phone → 6 breaths (4s in / 6s out) → say “Dad mode for the next hour”
  - Entry (2m): “floor drop” (get low/on the floor, narrate what they’re doing; no fixing/teaching)
  - Fallback: if too stressed, contain safely for 60s → 6 breaths → re-enter + floor drop
  - Track nightly: Ritual done (Y/N), Presence (0/1/2), Biggest breaker (1–3 words)
- If-success-then: Add one physical cue for WFH mode switch (e.g., remove work headphones / change shirt / “dad hat”) and test for another 5 days.
